# Piano Diagnostics

### Basic Features:
Step user through acquisition of 88 notes from a piano.
Aid the playing of each note so intensity and duration are consistent.
Store notes.
Perform signal processing.

### Goals:
Analysis of piano sound timbre.
Track changes in acoustic piano over time.

### Architecture:
Similar to an architecture I have been using for many of my musical computer science projects (very, very few are on github). Python for server. Javascript or Typescript for client. Simple socket interface. HTML canvas for graphics. Mostly I spend my time on applications not the infrastructure.
